I was commissioned by Australian artist [Adam Oriti](https://adamoriti.art) to create a portfolio website showcasing his abstract paintings and digital works.
You can read more about him on his [bio page](https://adamoriti.art/bio).
He wanted a website that was minimal, clean and puts the artwork front and center.

Over the years, Adam has created hundreds of paintings in many different styles, so he wanted a design that would allow people to view his evolution as an artist.
