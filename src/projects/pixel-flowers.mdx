Pixel Flowers was originally designed to be the framework for a series of [NFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) inspired by the likes of [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) and [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/).
The original plans were abandoned, but the art was finished, and I liked it so much I wanted it to live on as art project.

Each Pixel Flower consists of a series of parts that layer together to form the complete flowers.
There are:

- 22 different petal styles
- 16 stems
- 13 pistils
- and 15 pots

When you consider each part can be any color, there are almost endless combinations.
You can get an idea of what this looks like by visiting the [endless garden], where you can keep scrolling to endlessly generate Pixel Flowers.

The Pixel Flowers website also features a [Designer](http://pixelflowers.roscoe.dev/designer) that lets you create your own flowers and share them with your friends.
