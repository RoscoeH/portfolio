rTimer is a visual timer with quick and intuitive controls. Set the duration by dragging your finger around the face of the clock and tap START.
While dragging, both duration and end-time are displayed, enabling precise control of your time.
Timers can be saved as shortcuts and given their own name and color.

This project was inspired by the fantastic app on the Google Play Store, [Timebox Timer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kempmobil.timer&hl=en_AU&gl=US).
