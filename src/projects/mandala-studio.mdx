Created as a hackathon entry, Mandala Studio is a simple tool for creating mandala patterns.

Drag your finger (or your mouse) on the screen to draw and your pattern will be replicated along multiple lines of symmetry.
You can use the options to change the pen size, pen color and background color.
You can also hide the guidelines and customize the lines of symmetry.
