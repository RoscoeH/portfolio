Created as a hackathon entry, Mandala Studio is a simple tool for creating mandala patterns.

Drag your finger (or your mouse) on the screen to draw and your pattern will be replicated along multiple lines of symmetry.
You can change the pen size, pen color, background color and customize the lines of symmetry.

When you're happy with your drawing, you can save it as an image.
